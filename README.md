-- Script function --
To backup users /home/Documents folder

Save location local= /home/<user>/backup
Save location remote= <user>@<remote-server> /home/<user>/backup/ via ssh

If remote server is not availabla use "document-backup-local.sh"

Script automatically removes backup files over 5days locally, and 10days remotely.

--Remote server setup-- 
1. username needs to be identical on remote server
		- add folder "backup" to users remote home folder
2. ssh needs to be enabled on both client and server with ssh-key
		- to add ssh-key use command locally:
			ssh-keygen 
			ssh-copy-id <remote-server>
3. ssh needs to be able to export script variable 
		- add "SendEnv NODE" to end of file /etc/ssh/ssh_config on remote server.
4. change ip address to your local ip. ip addresses locaded on line 13 14 15.

that's it
